Arsineh Boodaghian Asl, Jayanth Raghothama, Adam Darwich, Sebastiaan Meijer. 

This is the code for dynamic nonlinear flow algorithm. To run the algorithm, use the "main.py" python file. In line 9 indicate the dataset file name and in line 61 indicate the duration in days for the algorithm to simulate the hospital. "dynamic_nonlinear_flow_algorithm.py" is the modified flow algorithm code and "dependencies.py" are the functions used in the algorithm, in this case depth-first-search (dfs) algorithm.

# Dynamic Nonlinear Flow Algorithm
A modified version of flow algorithm for dynamic nonlimear flows

* modified dinitz flow algorithm Description:
* This is a dynamic non-linear flow algorithm based on dinitz flow algorithm.
* Furthermore, the algorithm is modified to provide two type of outputs: 1) Residual graph, 2) minmax graph.
* The residual graph's lowest value indicates a strong bottleneck, the mixmax graph shows the persistency of the botttlneck.
* If the variance in minmax graph is small, it means that there is a persistent bottleneck toward that ward.
* The algorithm can be used for problem-solving and optimization of hospitals and it is a much more efficient substitution for simulation.
* To evaludate the algorithm both outputs are compared to the simulation output.

# A Dynamic Nonlinear Flow Algorithm to Model Patient Flow

**Authors**: Arsineh Boodaghian Asl, Jayanth Raghothama, Adam Darwich, Sebastiaan Meijer  

This repository contains the code for the **dynamic nonlinear flow algorithm** described in our research work.

## Usage

1. To run the algorithm, use the `main.py` file.
   - Line 9: Indicate the dataset file name.
   - Line 61: Indicate the duration (in days) for the simulation.

2. Other files:
   - `dynamic_nonlinear_flow_algorithm.py`: Contains the modified flow algorithm code.
   - `dependencies.py`: Includes utility functions such as the depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm.
3. Visualization files:
   - `line_chart.py` visualizes the wards behaviour.
   - `network_visualization.py` visualizes the network of flows.
   - `persistency.py` visualizes the persistency of the bottlenecks.
   - `severity.py` visualizes the severity of the bottlenecks.
   - `overflow.py` visualizes the overflow of the wards.
